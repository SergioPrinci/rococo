A discord.py bot, open-source alternative to Karuta

Now with SQL databases for better and faster management

This is an open-source discord.py alternative to Karuta Bot, which is a great bot for fun on discord groups.
Setup is pretty simple: 

-Download the ZIP and decompress it

-Install with pip the modules discord, pillow and sqlite3

-Add cards to the images folder and add them manually to the SQL database (I will develop a way to add them automatically to the database in the future)

-Run the bot before making it join the guild via the discord developer portal link

-Enjoy!

For every problem, or tip, tell me, I will be happy to help/answer!
