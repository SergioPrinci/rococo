<h1>A discord.py bot, open-source alternative to Karuta</h1>

_Now with SQL databases for better and faster management_

<p>This is an open-source discord.py alternative to Karuta Bot, which is a great bot for fun on discord groups.<p>
<p>Setup is pretty simple:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Download the ZIP and decompress it</li>

  <li>Install with pip the modules discord, pillow and sqlite3</li>

  <li>Add cards to the images folder and add them manually to the SQL database (I will develop a way to add them automatically to the database in the future)</li>

  <li>Run the bot before making it join the guild via the discord developer portal link</li>

  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
